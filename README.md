In this exercise, I created a Javascript file that gives the user a prompt asking for their choice of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors. After the user chooses, the computer also makes a choice. The two choices are then compared to each other and a win, loss, or draw call is made. The result is displayed at the end of each of the five rounds. This is currently meant to only be played in the console.
